    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2>Home Page: Introduction to Neuroscience and Brain Function</h2>
    <p>Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral
        nerves. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including biology, psychology, and medicine. Understanding
        brain function is essential for unraveling the mysteries of human behavior, cognition, and emotion.</p>

    <p>The human brain is an incredibly complex organ, consisting of approximately 86 billion neurons that communicate
        through trillions of synapses. It is responsible for our thoughts, emotions, memories, and movements, making it
        central to our existence.The brain is divided into various regions, each responsible for specific functions. For
        instance, the cerebrum, the largest part of the brain, is involved in higher cognitive functions such as
        reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Meanwhile, the cerebellum plays a critical role in coordinating
        movement and balance, highlighting the intricate specialization within this remarkable organ.</p>

    <!-- Neuroplasticity --> <hr>
    <h2>Neuroplasticity: How the Brain Adapts and Changes</h2>
    <p>Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to experiences, learning, and injury. This remarkable property allows the brain to form new neural connections throughout life, enabling recovery from trauma and adaptation to new environments.</p>

    <p>Neuroplasticity is particularly prominent during childhood, a period when the brain is rapidly developing and learning new skills. However, recent research has shown that adults also retain significant plasticity, allowing them to continue learning and adapting well into old age.</p>
